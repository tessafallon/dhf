# TL;DR: YOU SHOULD DELETE THIS FILE

# This file iwas generated by Cucumber-Rails and is only here to get you a head start
# These step definitions are thin wrappers around the Capybara/Webrat API that lets you
# visit pages, interact with widgets and make assertions about page content.
#
# If you use these step definitions as basis for your features you will quickly end up
# with features that are:
#
# * Hard to maintain
# * Verbose to read
#
# A much better approach is to write your own higher level step definitions, following
# the advice in the following blog posts:

# By default, any exception happening in your Rails application will bubble up
# to Cucumber so that your scenario will fail. This is a different from how 
# your application behaves in the production environment, where an error page will 
# be rendered instead.
#
# Sometimes we want to override this default behaviour and allow Rails to rescue
# exceptions and display an error page (just like when the app is running in production).
# Typical scenarios where you want to do this is when you test your error pages.
# There are two ways to allow Rails to rescue exceptions:
#
# 1) Tag your scenario (or feature) with @allow-rescue
#
# 2) Set the value below to true. Beware that doing this globally is not
# recommended as it will mask a lot of errors for you!
#
ActionController::Base.allow_rescue = false

# Remove this line if your app doesn't have a database.
# For some databases (like MongoDB and CouchDB) you may need to use :truncation instead.
